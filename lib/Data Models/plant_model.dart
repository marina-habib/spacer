Its immense size and temperature are fueled by nuclear fusion, a process that combines hydrogen atoms into helium, releasing vast amounts of energy.

      title: "Mercury: The Closest Planet",
      about: """Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in our solar system. Despite its proximity, it is not the hottest planet because it lacks a substantial atmosphere to retain heat. As a result, Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations between its scorching days and freezing nights. Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling Earth's Moon, and it has no moons of its own. Mercury completes an orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days, making it the fastest planet in the solar system. However, it rotates slowly, so one day on Mercury (sunrise to sunrise) lasts about 176 Earth days.""",

However, its thick atmosphere, composed primarily of carbon dioxide, traps heat, making it the hottest planet in our solar system. This greenhouse effect has created a hostile environment with temperatures hot enough to melt lead.

It has polar ice caps, ancient riverbeds, and evidence of past volcanic activity, suggesting that it once had a warmer, wetter climate.
